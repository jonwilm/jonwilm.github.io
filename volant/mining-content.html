  <p>A 900-acre remote aggregate mine was looking for a way to optimize their resource management. Traditional methods were inadequate due to their inaccuracy in volumetric measurement.  They were also highly risky due to the extremely steep terrain of the site, which had significant landslide risk.  The combination of UAV mapping capabilities, intelligent cameras and IoT sensors offered numerous advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An Increase in Volumetric Measurement Accuracy</li>
    <li>Adherence to Environmental Regulations</li>
    <li>Increased Safety for Personnel</li>
    <li>Increased Security of the perimeter</li>
    <li>Improved Tracking of Assets for Insurance Claims</li>
  </ul>
