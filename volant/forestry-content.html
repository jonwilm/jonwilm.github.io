  <p>An international forestry company was losing millions of dollars per year in 5,000 acres of their most remote assets.  The location asset volumes were difficult to assess and constantly under threat of fire, pests, disease and theft.  Manned towers, their traditional approach, were expensive and were not reliable due to human error.  Mapping with drones was the first step in setting up an intelligent, always-on monitoring platform, which would yield numerous benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An Increase in Inventory Quantification Accuracy</li>
    <li>Accurate Measurement of Waste (Dried Wood on the Ground) and Fuels</li>
    <li>Identification & Monitoring of Machine or Personnel Accessible Terrain</li>
    <li>Increase in Accuracy of Tree Mortality Rate</li>
    <li>Intelligent & Advanced Fire Detection Capabilities</li>
  </ul>
