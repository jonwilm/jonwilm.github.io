  <p>An international construction company that was developing an apartment complex was facing government fines for the supposed misuse of natural waters. They needed to find the source of the water and monitor quality.  They also needed to understand the risks associated with potential flooding and other environmental implications and plan around them.  The core solution focused on aerial mapping to inform decision-making and enable the company to develop an efficient plan toward compliance.   An intelligent 24/7 monitoring system, enabled by 30X Zoom/ Thermal cameras and numerous IoT sensors was the ideal tool to support the construction process and both ensure and prove governmental regulation compliance into the future.</p>
