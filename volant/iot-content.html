  <p>With a population of almost 4 million people and a population density of 10,351 residents living per square kilometer Medellín, Colombia had reached a crisis situation with the levels of contaminants in the air.  While the government had pollution reduction programs in place, they didn’t have an accurate way of knowing if they were working.  A decision was made to develop a system that would constantly and accurately measure contamination levels throughout the city.  IoT connected sensors were the ideal solution as they were economical, inconspicuous and operated 24/7.</p>
